# Introduction 
Hi, I'm vs-123. I am a passionate programmer. I have a deep sated interest in the inner workings of computers. My interests primarily revolve around low level development. I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and software.

C is my primary language of choice with a specific fondness for C99. I appreciate its efficintecy and the granular control it offers over machine state, and I find its philosophy aligns perfectly with my interest in building lean & transparent systems.

In addition to building software, I find myself fascinated by the core mechanics of programming languages and their implementations. This often leads me to exploring compilers via Godbolt, where I dissect the assembly generated by different C compilers. I find it enjoyable to analyse how various compilers handle various optimisation passes and architecture specific optimisations. I treat the translation from code to machine instructions as a field of study in itself.
