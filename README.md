# Introduction 
Hi, I'm vs-123. I am a passionate programmer. I have a deep-seated interest in the inner workings of computers. My interests primarily revolve around low-level development. I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and software.

C is my primary language of choice with a specific fondness for C99. I appreciate its efficintecy and the granular control it offers over machine state, and I find its philosophy aligns perfectly with my interest in building lean & transparent systems.

## Interests

I find myself fascinated by the core mechanics of different programming languages and the way they're implemented. This often leads me to find myself exploring different compilers via Godbolt, where I read and understand the assembly generated by various different compilers. I find it enjoyable to learn and analyse how various compilers handle various optimisation passes and architecture specific optimisations. I treat the translation from code to machine instructions as a field of study in itself.

My time spent with Compiler Explorer has deeply influenced my development workflow. It has helped me develop a habit of making low-level optimisation decisions as I write code. This practice gives me a rough yet grounded intuition about the potential memory layout, cache locality and the precise state transitions the hardware performs during execution of my programs.

As a result of learning and analysing how different compilers target various ISAs, I've gained a well familiarity with several architectures including but not limited to x86-64, x86, MIPS, ARM32/64 and MPPA. This has allowed me to reason about code performance across a wide and diverse range of platforms. 

This exposure with a diverse range of assemblies has granted me the advantage of being able to intuitively read and understand most assemblies, even for architectures I haven't formally encountered before. I find this skill incredibly helpful when debugging programs or reverse-engineering.

This grasp on assembly developed over the years, combined with my interest in language implementation, has led me to a much deeper understanding of the core mechanics of a computer. It allows me to evaluate the specific trade-offs and underlying philosophies offered by different programming languages from the POV of how they actually work under the hood.

In addition to code, I enjoy exploring the philosophies of different software and their communities. This curiosity drives my appreciation for Linux, UNIX, *nixes as well as the POSIX standard. I understand and appreciate the historical design patterns and the ideologies emerged historically. I find more interest in the "why" of a system's design more than I do in the "how" of its execution.

<summary>MIPS Compiler Magic: Branch Delay Slot</summary>

Consider the following simple C code:
```c
int add(int x, int y) {
   return x + y;
}

```

When we compile it with `-O3` targetting MIPS, we get this assembly:
```as
add:
   jr     $31
   addu   $2,$4,$5

```

Notice something interesting is going on here. It does the addition *after* returning from the function. What's going on?

Just FYI:
- `$31` is the return address (RA).
- `$2` holds the return value (V0).
- `$4` and `$5` are arguments `x` and `y`.
- `jr $31` is the jump register (i.e. return) instruction.

At first glance, it looks like the function returns before it ever adds the numbers. However this is a special hardware feature of MIPS called the Branch Delay Slot (BDS).

In a general MIPS pipeline, the instruction immediately following a branch or jump is executed *before* the jump actually completes. Usually when you have a compiler without optimisations, the compiler's just gonna put a `nop` there to waste time.

However in this case, the C compiler is actually being efficient here. Instead of doing something like:
```as
addu $2,$4,$5   # (cycle 1)
jr   # $31 (cycle 2)
nop   # (delay slot, wasted)
```

The compiler actually reorders the instructions so that the addition happens INSIDE the jump's delay slot. It essentially hides the cost of the addition within the time the processor spends resolving the jump. We get our result in what feels like a single operation.

It's pretty interesting to see how the compiler "exploits" specific hardware quirks like this to strip off potential inefficiencies
