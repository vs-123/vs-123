# Introduction 
Hi, I'm vs-123. I am a passionate programmer. I have a deep-seated interest in the inner workings of computers. My interests primarily revolve around low-level development. I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and software.

C is my primary language of choice with a specific fondness for C99. I appreciate its efficintecy and the granular control it offers over machine state, and I find its philosophy aligns perfectly with my interest in building lean & transparent systems.

## Interests

I find myself fascinated by the core mechanics of different programming languages and the way they're implemented. This often leads me to find myself exploring different compilers via Godbolt, where I read and understand the assembly generated by various different compilers. I find it enjoyable to learn and analyse how various compilers handle various optimisation passes and architecture specific optimisations. I treat the translation from code to machine instructions as a field of study in itself.

My time spent with Compiler Explorer has deeply influenced my development workflow. It has helped me develop a habit of making low-level optimisation decisions as I write code. This practice gives me a rough yet grounded intuition about the potential memory layout, cache locality and the precise state transitions the hardware performs during execution of my programs.

As a result of learning and analysing how different compilers target various ISAs, I've gained a well familiarity with several architectures including but not limited to x86-64, x86, MIPS, ARM32/64 and MPPA. This has allowed me to reason about code performance across a wide and diverse range of platforms. 

This exposure with a diverse range of assemblies has granted me the advantage of being able to intuitively read and understand most assemblies, even for architectures I haven't formally encountered before. I find this skill incredibly helpful when debugging programs or reverse-engineering.

This grasp on assembly developed over the years, combined with my interest in language implementation, has led me to a much deeper understanding of the core mechanics of a computer. It allows me to evaluate the specific trade-offs and underlying philosophies offered by different programming languages from the POV of how they actually work under the hood.

In addition to code, I enjoy exploring the philosophies of different software and their communities. This curiosity drives my appreciation for Linux, UNIX, *nixes as well as the POSIX standard. I understand and appreciate the historical design patterns and the ideologies emerged historically. I find more interest in the "why" of a system's design more than I do in the "how" of its execution.
